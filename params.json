It is served by RESTful Rails API and utilizes JQuery's UI plugin to create an interactive user experience. It is a 100% asynchronous single-page app that allows for WYSIWYG text editing, version tracking, and image uploading. Stores uploaded files with AWS S3.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
