It is served by RESTful Rails API and utilizes JQuery's UI plugin to create an interactive user experience. It is a 100% asynchronous single-page app that allows for WYSIWYG text editing, version tracking, and image uploading.\r\n\r\n### Blurred\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/geehaws/Blurred\r\n\r\nThis is a Newsblur clone, also built in Javascript on Backbone and served by a Rails API. It is an asynchronous single page RSS reader that allows the user to view external web pages within a frame in the app; no need to leave the page! It allows for seamless transitions between in-app views and external articles.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
